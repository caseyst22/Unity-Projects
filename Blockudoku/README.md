# Blockudoku
My version of a game I was extremely addicted to for over a year. A combination of tetris and sudoku, the goal is to fill squares, rows, and columns with the different shaped blocks in order to gain points and make them disappear, allowing player to place more blocks. Although I have overcome my addiction, while making this game I would still find myself playing it for extended periods of time. I'm also convinced, after playing my version, that the original developers intentionally made their game harder the longer you played by giving the player blocks that would not fit well with the current board. I did not implement this feature due to a combination of my sense of honor and not knowing how.
